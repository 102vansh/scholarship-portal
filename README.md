Certainly! I'll add a detailed installation and setup section to the README. This will provide step-by-step instructions for setting up both the frontend and backend of the Scholarship Management System.

---

## Installation and Setup

Follow these steps to set up the Scholarship Management System on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14.0.0 or later)
- npm (v6.0.0 or later)
- MongoDB (v4.0 or later)
- Git

### Cloning the Repository

1. Open your terminal
2. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/scholarship-management-system.git
   cd scholarship-management-system
   ```

### Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```
   cd backend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the backend directory and add the following environment variables:
   ```
   PORT=6001
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/scholarship_db
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
   CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloudinary_cloud_name
   CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_cloudinary_api_key
   CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_cloudinary_api_secret
   ```
   Replace the values with your actual MongoDB URI, JWT secret, and Cloudinary credentials.

4. Start the backend server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```
   The server should now be running on `http://localhost:6001`

### Frontend Setup

1. Open a new terminal window and navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the frontend directory and add the following:
   ```
   REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:6001/api/v1
   ```

4. Start the frontend development server:
   ```
   npm start
   ```
   The frontend should now be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`

### Database Setup

1. Ensure MongoDB is installed and running on your system.

2. The backend will automatically create the necessary collections when it connects to the database.

### Cloudinary Setup

1. Sign up for a Cloudinary account if you haven't already.

2. Get your Cloudinary cloud name, API key, and API secret from your Cloudinary dashboard.

3. Update the `.env` file in the backend directory with these credentials.

### Testing the Setup

1. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000`

2. You should see the login page of the Scholarship Management System.

3. Try registering a new user to ensure the backend and database are working correctly.

### Troubleshooting

- If you encounter any "module not found" errors, try running `npm install` again in both frontend and backend directories.
- Ensure MongoDB is running and accessible.
- Check that all environment variables are correctly set in the `.env` files.
- If you face CORS issues, ensure the backend CORS configuration includes your frontend URL.

### Additional Configuration (Optional)

#### Email Setup (for notifications)

1. If you want to enable email notifications, add the following to your backend `.env` file:
   ```
   EMAIL_SERVICE=your_email_service
   EMAIL_USERNAME=your_email_username
   EMAIL_PASSWORD=your_email_password
   ```

2. Update the email configuration in `backend/config/email.js` if necessary.


### Next Steps

After successful installation:

1. Create test users for different roles (student, HOD, principal, finance head).
2. Set up initial scholarship data in the database.
3. Test the workflow from application submission to approval and fund disbursement.

   - Review applications from their department
   - Approve or reject applications
   - Provide feedback on applications

3. **For Principal:**
   - Review and make final decisions on applications
   - Set scholarship criteria and guidelines
   - Generate reports on scholarship programs

4. **For Finance Head:**
   - Allocate funds for approved scholarships
   - Track disbursement of scholarship funds
   - Generate financial reports

## Technology Stack

### Frontend
- React.js
- Redux Toolkit
- Redux Persist
- Axios
- React Router
- Tailwind CSS
- React Hot Toast

### Backend
- Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDB
- Cloudinary (for file storage)
- JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication

## How It Works

1. **Student Application Process:**
   - Students register/login and can view available scholarships.
   - They apply by filling out an online form and uploading necessary documents.
   - Students can track their application status in real-time.

2. **HOD Review Process:**
   - HODs log in to view applications from their department.
   - They review each application, provide feedback, and make initial approval or rejection decisions.

3. **Principal's Final Review:**
   - The Principal reviews applications approved by HODs.
   - They make the final decision to approve or reject applications.

4. **Finance Management:**
   - The Finance Head creates scholarship listings and allocates funds.
   - They track fund disbursement and generate financial reports.

5. **Reporting and Notifications:**
   - The system generates various reports for analysis and decision-making.
   - Users receive notifications about application status changes and important updates.
